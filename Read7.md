# HTTP Methods

* **GET**
    * `GET is used to request data from a specified resource.` 
    * `GET is one of the most common HTTP methods.`
    * `Some other notes on GET requests:`
        * *GET requests can be cached*
        * *GET requests remain in the browser history*
        * *GET requests can be bookmarked*
        * *GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data*
        * *GET requests have length restrictions*
        * *GET requests are only used to request data (not modify)*

* **POST**
    * `POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.`
    * `POST is one of the most common HTTP methods.`
    * `Some other notes on POST requests:`
        * *POST requests are never cached*
        * *POST requests do not remain in the browser history*
        * *POST requests cannot be bookmarked*
        * *POST requests have no restrictions on data length*

* **PUT**
    * `PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.`
